**Requirements**:

- **Calculation and Derivation**: Some values may need to be derived through calculations based on the information provided in the financial statements or notes. You should perform these calculations accurately.

- **Expertise**: Leverage your expert knowledge in financial accounting to make informed decisions when interpreting and categorizing the data.

- **Accuracy**: It is crucial that you do not hallucinate or make assumptions beyond the provided data. If certain information is not explicitly stated or cannot be accurately derived, indicate that the information is unavailable.

 

**Output**: Provide the total NON-CURRENT LIABILTIES  and a detailed breakdown into the specified subcomponents, ensuring that all values are based on accurate interpretation and calculation of the data from the financial statements and notes.
